    "\n",
    "- This coursework counts for 20% of the marks of Foundations of Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The coursework is designed to assess the following course Learning Outcomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Describe and apply good practices for storing, manipulating, summarising, and visualising data.\n",
    "    2. Use standard packages and tools for data analysis and describing this analysis, such as Python and LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is marked based on the PDF export from a Jupyter notebook (see __General instructions__ below), which you are to submit via Gradescope (see __Assessment/Coursework 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation__ folder in Learn).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assignment is marked out of 100 and the number of points is indicated by each question. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We will assess your work on the following criteria:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - functional code that\n",
    "    (a) performs the computations asked for, as measured by verifying some of the numeric outputs from your processing and reading your code if there is doubt about what you have done and\n",
    "    (b) is clear and makes good use of Pandas functions\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - the quality of the visualisations, measured against the _Visualisation principles and guidance_ handout used in the [S1 Week 5 workshop](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/inf2-fds/course-materials/semester-1/week-5/workshop) \n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "- Read the instructions carefully, answering only what is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you are running a Jupyter Notebook that saves PDFs in the correct way, via LaTeX -- [using Noteable with the instructions here works](https://github.com/Inf2-FDS/FDS-CW1-2425/blob/main/README.md).\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "- Keep your answers brief and concise - in the PDF output, textual answers should remain inside the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving numerical values, use correct units where appropriate and format floating point values to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving visualisations:\n",
    "  - Make sure to label the visualisations clearly and provide titles, and legends where necessary, as per the _Visualisation Principles and Guidance_.\n",
    "  - All visualisations have to fit on one page. For example, 3 graphs on 3 separate pages counts as 3 visualisations; We would only mark one of these 3 visualisations.\n",
    "  - \"One visualisation\" could  be a figure with multiple subplots, for example created using the Matplotlib subplot and grid system.\n",
    "  - Creating plots in separate code cells that appear on the same page is not recommended. We may consider both plots as one visualisation, but mark you down for it. At worst we may only mark one visualisation.\n",
    "  - Please follow the guidance on font size in the _Visualisation Principles and Guidance_, i.e. a real font size of 8 points at a minimum. We instruct the markers to view all submissions at the same magnification and not to zoom in, to give a fair comparison between students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We strongly recommend restarting the kernel and running all (__Kernel→Restart & Run all__) from time to time, to test your code works properly. \n",

    "## How long should I spend on this coursework?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have designed the coursework to take around 10 hours for a student who has completed the lab sessions, attended the lectures and workshops and done the comprehension questions. There will be some spread around this value, but if you're up-to-date with the course, and you're taking much longer than 10 hours (say 14 hours), then you might want to consider how many marks you are gaining for each extra hour of work.\n",

    "# Overview of the coursework and the Food Balance and Emissions datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In Question 1, we will start exploring the [Food balance dataset](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS), which we have downloaded from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations¹. The Food Balance dataset includes detailed information on how much food a country in Europe has supplied during a certain time period (2010-2021). The dataset has the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Area Code__: Code of the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Area__: Name of the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Item Code__: A code representing the specific item being reported, for example, 2511 for \"Wheat and products\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Item__: The name of the specific item being reported, for example, \"Wheat and products\". This column also contains rows labelled \"Population\", which reports the population of the corresponding country, and \"Grand Total\", which shows the total food supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Element Code__: A code for the aspect of the food measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Element__: The aspect of the food measured, for example, \"Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Unit__: The unit used for measurement in the Element column, for example, \"kilograms\" or \"kilocalories\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Y2010__: The food supply value for 2010. Similar columns are available for the remaining years up to 2021, i.e. Y2011, Y2012, ... \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the data tells us how much food a country had available and what happened to it. It can also tell a story about how the food is used - whether it's exported, used for animals, or processed into other products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Question 2, will focus on the [Emissions dataset](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT)², which includes greenhouse gas emissions produced by agricultural and food systems, encompassing gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide, along with emissions from industrial processes. The data spans from 1961 to 2020, with predictions available for 2030 and 2050 in some cases. Emissions are measured in kilotonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent and originate from various sources within agriculture and food production, including farming, land use changes, and food processing. This dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Area Code__: Code of the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Area__: Name of the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Item Code__: A code representing the specific item being reported, for example, 5060 for \"Rice Cultivation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Item__: Name of the specific item being reported, for example, \"Rice Cultivation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Element Code__: A code representing the specific element or aspect of the item being measured, for example, 7225 for \"Emissions (CH4)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Element__: Name of the specific element or aspect of the item being measured, for example, \"Emissions (CH4)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Unit__: The unit of measurement used for the data, for example, \"kilotonnes (kt)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Y1961__: The emission value for the year 1961. Similar columns are available for the rest of the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll combine Food Balance data with Emissions data in Question 3 to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Through a series of questions and data manipulation tasks, we will create meaningful visualisations and perform trend analysis to identify patterns regarding food availability, usage, and environmental factors of food production in various European countries. These insights can aid in agricultural planning and facilitate sustainable decision-making to ensure an environmentally friendly food supply. The questions are organised so that the first few questions give more detailed instructions and Question 4 is more open-ended. We also want you to consider whether there are any limitations of the data that should be considered. Finally, the datasets used in this notebook are not large enough to cause issues, but do consider computational complexity and efficiency of your code.\n",
